4hp DIY eurorack line and headphone output module based on [Exits](https://github.com/ramphands/Exits) which is in part based on [Nearness](https://github.com/sarnesjo/nearness) and [Forestcaver headphone amp](https://github.com/forestcaver/Analog-Voice/tree/master/AJH_Headphone_Amp) designs. 

The Nearness section is a "minimal panning mixer for the Eurorack modular synthesizer system. Seven inputs, two outputs. The closer an input is to an output, the greater its influence on it."  

This design makes the following changes:
- Changed to a 1U format
- Reestablishes front panel L and R outputs
- In lieu of a stereo 1/4 main out, has a six-pin connector that is compatible with Intellijel cases.
- NE5532 in lieu of NJM4556 for the headphone portion
