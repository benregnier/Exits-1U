4hp DIY eurorack line and headphone output module based on [Exits](https://github.com/ramphands/Exits) which is in part based on [Nearness](https://github.com/sarnesjo/nearness) and [Forestcaver headphone amp](https://github.com/forestcaver/Analog-Voice/tree/master/AJH_Headphone_Amp) designs. 

The Nearness section is a "minimal panning mixer for the Eurorack modular synthesizer system. Seven inputs, two outputs. The closer an input is to an output, the greater its influence on it."  

This design makes the following changes:
- Changed to a 1U format
- Reestablishes front panel L and R outputs
- In lieu of a stereo 1/4 main out, has a six-pin connector that is compatible with Intellijel cases.
- NE5532 in lieu of NJM4556 for the headphone portion



## Schematic and PCBs

The [kicad](Kicad) directory contains the schematic and PCB layout as a KiCad 6 project.

## Panel

Available in the [panel](Panel) directory as a PDF and an SVG vector file as well as PCB design and gerbers.

## Intellijel Output Pinout

This module has a six pin connector on the back meant to be compatible with outputs on Intellijel and Befaco cases. Pinouts match per the diagram below. Outputs are not balanced.
